## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

**Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 

**Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

# This assignment helped me learn how to work with real-world data and turn it into useful visualizations. At first, I had to set up my computer properly by installing the necessary Python packages through the terminal. This preparation step showed me how important it is to have everything ready before starting to code. The main work involved processing Syracuse parking ticket data to identify the busiest locations and understand ticket patterns. I created three different data files - one listing high-ticket locations, another with map coordinates for these spots, and a third showing all tickets from these areas. Checking my work with automated tests was really helpful, as the green checkmarks told me when my code worked correctly.

# The most interesting part was building the two dashboards to visualize the data. The heatmap made it easy to see where parking tickets happened most often, while the second dashboard let users pick specific locations to see ticket trends by day and time. I ran into some challenges, like getting the map to display properly and making sure my charts showed accurate information. Breaking the project into smaller steps - first organizing the data, then creating visualizations - made the work much more manageable. The automatic grading system was useful because it quickly showed what needed fixing. Through this project, I learned how data can tell important stories when presented visually, and I gained confidence in using Python for practical applications. Next time, I'd like to make my dashboards even more interactive and user-friendly.
